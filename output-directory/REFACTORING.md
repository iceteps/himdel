# Refactor Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for refactoring the codebase to improve organization, eliminate duplication, and ensure all code follows the established patterns.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Code Organization Issues

- Multiple utility functions with similar purposes
- Inconsistent file naming conventions
- Some components are too large and should be split

### 2. Type Organization Issues

- Type definitions scattered across files
- Some types are defined multiple times with slight variations

### 3. Consistency Issues

- Different patterns for handling asynchronous operations
- Multiple approaches to error handling
- Inconsistent prop naming conventions

## Proposed Changes

### 1. File Reorganization

Move files to more appropriate locations and establish clear conventions:

| Current Path | New Path | Reason |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| `/utils/helpers.js` | `/utils/string/helpers.js` | Group by functionality |
| `/components/BigComponent.js` | Split into multiple components | Component too large |

### 2. Type Consolidation

Create a centralized type system:

- Create a `/types` directory with domain-specific type files
- Consolidate duplicate type definitions
- Establish naming conventions for types

### 3. Pattern Standardization

Standardize common patterns:

- Create utility functions for common async operations
- Establish consistent error handling approaches
- Document and enforce naming conventions

## Estimated Impact

- **Files to modify**: ~25
- **Potential breaking changes**: None with proper deprecation strategy
- **Estimated diff size**: Medium (~500-1000 lines)

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize refactoring suggestions
2. Create a phased implementation plan
3. Implement high-impact, low-effort changes first
4. Update documentation and communicate changes
5. Establish automated checks to prevent regression
